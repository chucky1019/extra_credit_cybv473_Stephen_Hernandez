This repository contains Python-based security automation tools designed to simulate detection engineering, reconnaissance analysis, authentication monitoring, and secure coding practices.
The goal of these projects is to apply automation-first principles to common cybersecurity workflows, reduce manual analysis effort, and reinforce secure infrastructure design concepts aligned with modern enterprise security practices.
